JavaScript developers have access to a wide range of Browser APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable interaction with various features and capabilities of the web browser. Here are some of the most commonly used Browser APIs:

1. DOM (Document Object Model) API
The DOM API allows developers to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents. It provides methods and properties to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of web pages.

Example Methods and Properties:
document.getElementById(id): Selects an element by its ID.
element.innerHTML: Gets or sets the HTML content inside an element.
document.createElement(tagName): Creates a new element.


2. Fetch API
The Fetch API is used to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR), but with a more powerful and flexible feature set. It returns Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous requests.

Example:
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
